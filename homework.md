# Homework

## Instructions

Clone this repo and make a PR with your answers to the questions below, and tag your reviewer in the PR.

Keep good notes of the queries you run.

## Part 1: Missing Station Data

As we've discussed in class, some of the station_id columns are NULL because of missing data. We also have inconsistent names for some of the station IDs.

Your database contains a `stations` schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE stations
(
  id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
```

1. Write a query that fills out this table. Try your best to pick the correct station name for each ID. You may have to make some manual choices or editing based on the inconsistencies we've found. Do try to pick the correct name for each station ID based on how popular it is in the trip data.

Hint: your query will look something like

```sql
INSERT INTO stations (SELECT ... FROM tripe);
```

Hint 2: You don't have to do it all in one query

2. Should we add any indexes to the stations table, why or why not?

3. Fill in the missing data in the `trips` table based on the work you did above

## Part 2: Missing Date Data

You may have noticed that we have the dates as strings. This is because the dataset we have uses an inconsistent format for dates ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”

Note that the `original_filename` column is broken down into quarters, knowing this is helpful here!

1. What's the inconsistency in date formats? You can assume that each quarter's trips are numbered sequentially, starting with the first day of the first month of that quarter.

2. Take a look at Postgres's [date functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-datetime.html), and fill in the missing date data using proper timestamps. You may have to write several queries to do this.

Hint: your queries will look something like

```sql
UPDATE trips
SET start_time = ..., end_time = ...
WHERE ...;
```

3. Other than the index in class, would we benefit from any other indexes on this table? Why or why not?

## Part 3: Data-driven insights

Using the table you made in part 1 and the dates you added in part 2, let's answer some questions about the bike share data

1. Build a mini-report that does a breakdown of number of trips by month
2. Build a mini-report that does a breakdown of number trips by time of day of their start and end times
3. What are the most popular stations to bike to in the summer?
4. What are the most popular stations to bike from in the winter?
5. Come up with a question that's interesting to you about this data that hasn't been asked and answer it.

## HOMEWORK ANSWERS

## Part 1

### 1. Write a query that fills out this table. Try your best to pick the correct station name for each ID. You may have to make some manual choices or editing based on the inconsistencies we've found. Do try to pick the correct name for each station ID based on how popular it is in the trip data.

_get ids that map to more than one station_

```
SELECT from_station_id, count(distinct from_station_name)
FROM trips
GROUP BY from_station_id
ORDER BY count desc
```

^ this query shows how many ids have multiple station names (they need to be manually edited) and how many have only one station name (these can be written straight to the stations table)

_write a query that inserts ids with only one associated station into the stations table_

```
 INSERT INTO stations(
  SELECT from_station_id as id, max(from_station_name) as name
  FROM trips
  GROUP BY from_station_id
  HAVING count(distinct from_station_name) = 1
  ORDER BY name desc
)
```

_Used this query to get all the ids with more than one station:_

```
SELECT
array_agg(
distinct from_station_name),
count(DISTINCT from_station_name) as ct, from_station_id from trips
WHERE from_station_id IS NOT NULL
group by from_station_id
HAVING COUNT(distinct from_station_name) > 1
ORDER BY ct desc
```

_but I could not figure out a way to order the `array_agg` by which name had the higher count. So instead_

```
  insert into stations(
  SELECT from_station_id as id, max(from_station_name) as name
  FROM trips
  WHERE from_station_id IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY from_station_id
  HAVING count(distinct from_station_name) > 1
  ORDER BY name desc
  )
```

_I think this way at least took ONE of the station names associated with each id that had duplicates, and inserted that into stations._

### 2. Should we add any indexes to the stations table, why or why not?

_It might make sense to add an index to the ID in the stations table for quicker lookup by id._

### 3. Fill in the missing data in the trips table based on the work you did above
